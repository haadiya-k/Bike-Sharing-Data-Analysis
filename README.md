# Times Square Bike-Sharing Data Analysis

**Description**:  
This project explores the impact of weather conditions on bike-sharing usage in Times Square, NYC. Using data collected from the Citi Bike API and Tomorrow.io weather API, the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations between weather factors (such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity) and the number of daily bike rentals and returns. The data was collected over four consecutive days at 5-minute and 10-minute intervals, providing a detailed, real-time snapshot of bike usage and weather conditions.

**Key Features**:
- Python scripts for data collection from Citi Bike and Tomorrow.io APIs.
- Real-time data gathering for bike availability and weather conditions.
- Future analysis will include data visualization, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.

**Technologies**: Python, APIs, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Visualisations

### Scatter Plot: Bikes Rented and Bikes Returned vs Temperature

This plot visualizes the relationship between temperature and the number of bikes rented and returned in Times Square. It highlights trends where bike usage generally increases with warmer temperatures, but there are fluctuations in the data that require further exploration.

### Scatter Plot: Bikes Rented and Bikes Returned vs Wind Speed

This plot highlights how varying wind speeds may influence bike rentals and returns. While lower wind speeds seem to correspond with a range of rental and return values, higher wind speeds show a decrease in bike activity.

### Scatter Plot: Bikes Rented and Bikes Returned vs Humidity

This plot explores the relationship between humidity and bike usage. We can observe how changes in humidity might impact the number of bikes rented or returned, with bike activity generally decreasing at higher humidity levels.
